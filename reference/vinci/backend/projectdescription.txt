The intervention agent serves as the core intelligence system responsible for adaptive learning progression. It manages:

- **Progressive Pagination Logic**: Dynamically creates study session pages based on student performance, with each page containing optimally distributed problems across selected mathematical concepts
- **Performance-Based Difficulty Adjustment**: Implements sophisticated algorithms that analyze student accuracy rates and adjust subsequent problem difficulty using configurable threshold systems (70% accuracy triggers difficulty reduction, 90% triggers increase)
- **Time-Based Problem Allocation**: Calculates optimal problem distribution within target study time constraints, ensuring balanced coverage across selected concepts while maintaining appropriate cognitive load
- **Sequential Access Control**: Enforces linear progression through session pages, preventing students from skipping ahead without completing previous sections

#### Economy Agent (celebrationManager)
The economy agent manages student motivation and engagement through performance-based feedback systems:

- **Multi-Tiered Celebration System**: Implements 9 distinct celebration levels (0-8 intensity) based on score percentages, with customized messaging and visual feedback for different achievement ranges
